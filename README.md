Agentic Document Extraction Challenge
Goal:
Build an agent that:
ingests a document (PDF/image),
understands type/layout,
extracts a key-value JSON,
assigns a confidence score per field (+ overall),
evaluates accuracy
Requirements (what to build)
Agent loop (LangChain or similar)


Routing: detect doc type (invoice / bill / prescription)


OCR: for scans; handle tables and totals.


Extraction chain: LLM with structured output (Pydantic/JSONSchema) + post-processing.


Validation: regex/date/amount checks, cross-field rules (e.g., sum(line_items)=total).


Confidence scoring per field


Sample output:
{
  "doc_type": "invoice|medical_bill|prescription",
  "fields": [
    {"name":"PatientName","value":"Priya Sharma","confidence":0.91,"source":{"page":1,"bbox":[x1,y1,x2,y2]}}
  ],
  "overall_confidence": 0.88,
  "qa": {"passed_rules":["totals_match"],"failed_rules":[],"notes":"2 low-confidence fields"}
}
Recommended interface (streamlit)
Upload: PDF or image files
Optional field list: Text box to specify fields to extract (not mandatory to fill)
Auto-detect document type
Output: JSON (copy/download), per-field confidence bars, and an overall score
UI flexibility: Encourage experimentation and innovative UI ideas
LLM: Prefer OpenAI models for extraction
Scoring (100)
Extraction accuracy & UI (40) – Consistency across multiple runs, prompt quality, handling complex layouts etc
Confidence score (20) – Reliability & formula explanation 
Prompting & agent design (20) – routing, tool use, retries/guardrails etc
Performance & robustness (10) – timeouts, retries, idempotence etc
Dataset & repo quality (10) – Picking quality & complex datasets, ReadMe, Repo quality etc
Deliverables
Please deploy the Streamlit application and share a public access link.
Regularly commit and push the code to a GitHub repository, and share the repository link.
Optionally, provide a brief write-up on the solution approach.
Optionally, provide a brief write-up on the confidence score approach.
Dos:
Search for and use a quality dataset.
Use OpenAI models as the LLM (recommended).
You’re open to use any agentic tool - Open for innovation.
Build the solution as a Python project with clear structure.
Write clean, well-commented code so it’s easy to follow.
Maintain a readable project structure (folders for data, code, outputs).
Use Git for version control and commit regularly.
Document your setup and usage steps in a README.md.


Don’ts:
Don’t work in Google Colab or any kind of notebook environment.
Don’t just write ad-hoc “vibe code” — this task expects a deeper understanding of the implementation.
Don’t hardcode API keys or secrets in the code.
Nice-to-have (bonus points)
Confidence scoring mechanism – Well researched confidence scoring mechanism
Self-consistency prompting – multiple prompt runs + majority voting
Dynamic few-shot retrieval from a prompt/example library
Schema-aware validation & auto-correction (e.g., regex/date/amount checks).
Well-thought project structure & clean code organization – clear folder layout, modular functions, and readable code with comments.
